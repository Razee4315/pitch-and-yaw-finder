### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read [Documentation](README.md) to find out if the functionality is supported, if it is intended to be used in a specific way, or if it is a known issue.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/Razee4315/pitch-and-yaw-finder/issues) to see if the bug has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
